# Recipes
Recipes are short step by step guides to get specific services running on your Kubernetes cluster. They don't contain extensive explanation of concepts and are solely meant for getting you up and running with a tool without much hassle.

/Note: Some of these services might be hosted outside your cluster and need additional account information to set up./

The recipes published here have been tested and work on standard Giant Swarm Kubernetes clusters. While generally applicable to any Kubernetes installation they might be slightly adapted or specifically configured to the Giant Swarm out-of-the-box Kubernetes setup. Forks and PRs, however, are welcome.

*Note: Some recipes might break (or need adjustment) if you have changed essential configuration of your private Kubernetes cluster.*
