# Examples

Examples are longer form guides that explain specific application deployments showing useful functionality and concepts to use in your own applications and deployments.

The examples published here have been tested and work on standard Giant Swarm Kubernetes clusters. While generally applicable to any Kubernetes installation they have not been tested by the team. Forks and PRs, however, are welcome.

*Note: Some examples might break (or need adjustment) if you have changed essential configuration of your private Kubernetes cluster.*
